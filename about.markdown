I grew up in rural village called Devadaha in the Lumbini zone, the birthplace of the Buddha. My village is sandwiched between two small rivers and within 100 meters of the forest and with paddy fields all around. After finishing my high school in 2006, I decided to get a Bachelor's degree in Agriculture and graduated in 2010 with honors in Plant Breeding and Genetics. My research career started as a Research Assistant at the Entomology Division of Nepal Agriculture Research Council (NARC). NARC had received three parasitoids of Potato Tuber Moth from International Center for Potatoes (CIP) and I was assisting the Research Scientist to rear and mate the host insect and the parasitoids. I also assisted in studying efficacy of botanical pesticides in insect pest management (IPM).

In 2012, I left Nepal for Athens, Georgia where I was going to embark upon my career in genomics and breeding. I thorough enjoyed Athens and loved the vibe there until I had to go down south to Tifton, Georgia for my MS research. I learned a great deal of Molecular biology, translational and comparative genomics, and apomixis during my MS. Being in a peanut breeding lab, I took the chance to learn emasculating and crossing peanut flowers which was pretty meditative experience if you think about it. I graduated from University of Georgia in 2014 with a MS in Horticulture. My thesis research was on comparative genomics of apospory loci and carrier chromosome in Pennisetum at Ozias-Akins Lab at UGA. After graduating I worked for a few months as greenhouse technician in Scott Jackson's lab.
