I grew up in rural village called [Devadaha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devdaha) in the Lumbini zone, the birthplace of the Buddha. My village is sandwiched between two small rivers and within 100 meters of the forest and used to be full of paddy fields all around. 

After finishing my high school in 2006, I decided to get a Bachelor's degree in Agriculture and graduated in 2010 with honors in Plant Breeding and Genetics. My research career started as a Research Assistant at the Entomology Division of Nepal Agriculture Research Council (NARC). NARC had received three parasitoids of Potato Tuber Moth from International Center for Potatoes (CIP) and I was assisting the Research Scientist to rear and mate the host insect and the parasitoids. I also assisted in studying efficacy of botanical pesticides in insect pest management (IPM).

In 2012, I left Nepal for Athens, Georgia where I was going to embark upon my career in genomics and breeding. I thorough enjoyed Athens and loved the vibe there until I had to go down south to Tifton, Georgia for my MS research. I learned a great deal of Molecular biology, translational and comparative genomics, and apomixis during my MS. Being in a peanut breeding lab, I took the chance to learn emasculating and crossing peanut flowers which was pretty meditative experience if you think about it. I graduated from University of Georgia in 2014 with a MS in Horticulture. My [thesis](https://athenaeum.libs.uga.edu/handle/10724/31504) research was on comparative genomics of apospory loci and carrier chromosome in Pennisetum at Ozias-Akins Lab at UGA.

I continued on my academic training towards a doctorate at Clemson University in the Fall of 2015. I joined Kresovich Lab in 2016 and started working towards my dissertation research. My dissertation research was genomics-assisted breeding in sorghum. I had the opportunity to learn and train in statistics, quantitative genetics, population genomics and breeding. I finished my PhD in May 2020, and continued working at Kresovich lab in the 3P program, an ARPA-E TERRA project aimed at deploying high throughput phenotyping and genomics in breeding crops more efficiently. I am currently working as a Research Scientist to dissect genetic basis of heterosis in sorghum and to develop effective training population and prediction strategy for hybrid breeding. I am also involved in genomic data analysis and analysis of UAV images for usefulness in genomic prediction and breeding.

I want to continue working with genomic and phenomic data towards crop improvement. My mission is to equip farmers with locally adapted and better performing crop varieties and also to enhance culinary and food experiences for the customers and many stakeholders that are intricately associated with agriculture and the germplasm that serves the food production.
